# Generic OpenStack Swift Setup

This is an attempt to install OpenStack Swift in a portable manner. It should work on Debian and Arch Linux systems with either SysVinit or systemd init system.

[unibz-bobo/swman](https://github.com/unibz-bobo/swman) adds proper abstraction to make the script work both under Debian and Arch. We are open for pull request to add further platforms.

PS: documentation is available around the folder; please have a look at the "doc" folders, as well as scripts that contain a lot of comments. 

Good luck guys! ;=)
