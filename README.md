# Generic OpenStack Swift Setup

This is an attempt to install OpenStack Swift in a portable manner. It should work on Debian and Arch Linux systems with either SysVinit or systemd init system.

Please someone needs to clean this up, adding proper abstraction to make the script work both under Debian and Arch

PS: documentation is available around the folder; please have a look at the "doc" folders, as well as scripts that contain a lot of comments. 

Good luck guys! ;=)
