So, basically enabling a couple of services on the same machine is costly in terms of RAM

- Increase SWAP -> (This leads to slow responses due to SD card being slow actually)
    Yes sure this is the first attempt. But once everything is up and running, we shall
    deploy different services on different machines
    For example assigning 1-10 machines for every service

    Swap is by default 100 mb on the raspberry. We give it at least 300 mb (3x)
    sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile
