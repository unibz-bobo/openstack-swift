Error 507 Insufficient storage from Object Server; Proxy relays a 503 Service Unavailable
##########

This error has the following possible causes:

1) Disk is full. Nothing to add

2) Host filesystem does NOT support XATTRs. XFS does them as default so this wasn't the problem, altough
   several tests to assure that have been done.

3) Damn libc fallocate wrapper! fallocate native function appears to be broken on the Raspbian (debian wheezy?) operating
   system. A manual - and hopefully temporary - patch has been written to prefer posix_fallocate instead, which is
   flawlessly working.

   Absolutely obscure, a bug should be probably filled and submitted to the Openstack team.
